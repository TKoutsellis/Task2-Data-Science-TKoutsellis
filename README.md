# Data Science Task:

Please make an explorative data analysis and build a prediction model for the hourly utilization “cnt” of this data set:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset. 

Your solution will consist of a short analysis (text ~ 1 DIN A4 with additional pages for plots) 
and the relevant code your report is about (source files).

- In your report, present only one model, that you think is most suitable for a business-case.

Summarize your reasons for choosing this model.

Report the mean absolute deviations.

- Assume that the code you are writing is used in production in a daily prediction service and maintained by your colleagues
(what could that mean?)
